# Bonsai tree

## Reasoning
While I accept the integration of LLM's in our workflows, I'm starting to feel more and more lost whenever I think about my future career. <br/>
This change in our industry makes everything unclear, for me atleast <br/>
And above all, the work I do as a student feels less and less rewarding or meaningful. <br/>
Everything feels like if you don't use AI, you'll lack behind, which is true, yet it doesn't feel right at all. <br/>

## Program

This is a challenge I'm giving myself, create a procedural bonsai tree program with ncurses and in C, but there's a catch: <br/>
It'll be done the old fashioned way. <br/>
1. No Ai.
2. No Ide.
<br/>
Internet is allowed though as I still feel like there's a bit of a challenge in reading through documentations, to me atleast. <br/>

## Usage

None, the project isn't done <br/>
